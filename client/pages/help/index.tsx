        Hello there! ðŸ˜„ <br />
        <p>
          If you're here you're probably interested in not using BeReal in the
          way it was intended to be used, and to be honest thats why I mainly
          started this project too! Don't worry, there's no judgment ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          With TooFake, you can view friends' BeReals without posting your own.
          You can post custom images. You can add custom reactions and react to
          posts. You can also comment & react to posts without posting. You can
          also screenshot and download BeReals without being detected.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is completely{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/s-alad/toofake">open source</a> and still
          a work in progress. There are many issues that I know of and others
          that I don't know of; feel free to reach out with bugs or if you'd
          like to contribute!{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          It's based on a lot of the great work done at Notmarek's{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/notmarek/BeFake/tree/master">BeFake</a>{" "}
          and inspired by <a href="https://shomil.me/bereal/">shomil</a>. Go
          show them some support!
        </p>
        <p>
          BeReal continuously changes their code which sometimes breaks this
          project. I'll try to keep a status up on the homepage.

            <h3>Will I get banned from BeReal</h3>
            <p>
              TooFake, the BeFake project, and the old BeFake website have been
              running for over 10 months without anybody getting banned. Trends
              show you are safe! But as with everything there's always a small
              risk.
            </p>

          <div className={s.q}>
            <h3>Is TooFake safe?</h3>
            <p>
              TooFake is completely open source; you can check out the code
              here. It doesn't save any of your credentials. If you are
              uncomfortable using this client, you can run a local instance
              aswell!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className={s.q}>
            <h3>Why can't I login?</h3>
            <p>
              Logging in should currently be working. TooFake tries to log you
              in two times with two different BeReal providers; if both fail
              then there might be an issue I don't know of. Try refreshing the
              website and trying again.
            </p>

          <div className={s.q}>
            <h3>Can I screenshot or download friends' BeReals?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, you can take screenshots without notifying your friends. You
              can also press the download button on the bottom right of a BeReal
              to download the primary image

          <div className={s.q}>
            <h3>Why does the website crash when I try to post images?</h3>
            <p>
              If the images you are posting are .heic, .heif, (iphone images) or
              .webp images, the website will crash as it currently does not
              support those. Please try converting them or taking a screenshot
              of the photos and posting those.

              exception?
            </h3>
            <p>
              This might happen if there is some error that arises that we
              haven't handled. Please refresh the page or re-login

              Login by navigating to toofake.lol and entering your phone number.
              After that it will try to send a code using two providers, if one
              fails you'll see red and blue text notifying you it is trying the
              second. You should recieve a code. Enter the code and press enter
              once. You'll hopefully be redirected to the homepage where you can
              view BeReals.

              the images around. On mobile, click the big image to swap it to
              the small one.

              Select your primary and secondary image and add a caption. Submit
              the image and hopefully it'll get posted. Posting does not support

              the top right of a BeReal next to the username. This will show you
              your current reactions that you have. Click one to submit it,
              you'll see a loading sign and a check if it works or an X if it
              fails.

              up. Hopefully your reaction will get added. You'll see a loading
